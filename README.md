# 🔮 Shader Labs

A curated set of **GLSL shaders** for **Qt QML** and **Three.js**, suitable for **web, desktop, and mobile**.  
All showcased effects are **procedural** (math-driven), **fragment-shader only**, and **texture-free**.

---

## ✨ Highlights

- ✅ **No textures** — everything is generated mathematically in the fragment shader  
- 🎯 **Fragment-only** — uses the implicit full-screen quad from your pipeline  
- 🧩 **Qt QML & Three.js** — drop-in ShaderEffect / ShaderMaterial usage  
- ⚙️ **Uniform-driven** — color themes, speeds, and visibility toggles

## 🎬 Previews

### 🧪 UI Interface (Sci-Fi HUD)
A procedural sci-fi HUD: rings, halos, graphs, sliders, and dots - all generated in-shader.  
Themes and layouts are controlled via uniforms. **No textures.**

### 🔥 Flame
A fully procedural flame effect implemented in a **single fragment shader**.  
Animated via `u_time` and gradient uniforms. **No textures.**
